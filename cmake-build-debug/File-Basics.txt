	In order to work with data file, we need a FILe pointer in our program,
	FILE is a struct type declared in stdio.h, FILE pointer will hold the address 
	of the file object corresponding to the file with which we are suppose to 
	interact.
    
    To open the file, we ned to call the library function fopen() [declared in 
    stdio.h]. fopen function opens the specified file in specified mode and
    creates the FILE object, if fopen is successful in opening the file then 
    it returns the address of the corresponding FILE object, otherwise if fopen
    fails to open the file (in many occasion this may happen such as if the 
    supplied path or file name is invalid, permission of file creation is not
    available or wrong mode) then fopen returns NULL. It's always recommended 
    to check the return value of fopen before proceeding with the operations with
    the file.
    
	fopen() requires 2 parameters, first is the name of the file with path, if path 
	is not supplied then the file is looked up in the current directory from where this 
	program is executed. The second parameter to fopen is the mode of operations. 
	The different available mode of operations are given in the following list.


                Modes of file operations
                ------------------------
     Exclusive
                TEXT            BINARY
     WRITE      "w"             "wb"
     READ       "r"             "rb"
     APPEND     "a"             "ab"
     
     Multiple
     
     WRITE      "w+"             "wb+" or "w+b"
     READ       "r+"             "rb+" or "r+b"
     APPEND     "a+"             "ab+" or "a+b"
